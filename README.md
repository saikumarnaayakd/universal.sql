# universal.sql
I have completed a hand-on project creating a universe database through the freecodecamp teaching services.
'pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp universe > universe.sql' to insert code into the universe.sql file.
You can rebuild the database by entering 'psql -U postgres < universe.sql' in a terminal where the .sql file is.
